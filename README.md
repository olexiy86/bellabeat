## About this project
This case study is my capestone project of Google Data Analytics Certificate.
Main task of the project is to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices and apply these insights into one Bellabeat product. Discovered insights will help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

**A clear statement of the business task:**
Explore userâ€™s data (Fitbit) to identify trends and patterns in daily activities and identify key wellness indicators of healthy lifestyle.


**Questions:**
 - What are some trends in smart device usage?
 - What specific metrics indicate a more active lifestyle?
 - How could these trends impact Bellabeat marketing strategy?
